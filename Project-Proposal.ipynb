    "Studies have shown that attractive people are perceived as more interesting, self-confident, successful, kinder, and healthier. Since facial symmetry is positively correlated with attractiveness, one study wanted to determine if having a symmetrical face was responsible for the attribution of positive traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comes from a Qualtrics Survey from a student’s PSYC277 project. Survey participants were asked to rate eight images: four males and four females, two of each being symmetrical faces and two being asymmetrical. For each face, ratings for intelligence, kindness, and socioeconomic status from 1 to 6 were collected. Only complete responses from UBC students aged 18 to 24 are in the dataset. \n",

    "We will use three variables to analyze the given data: “face_type” (“Symmetrical” or “Asymmetrical”) is the variable to represent the class; “avg_intelligence” represents the perception of being intelligent by the respondents as an average rating value from respondents; “avg_kindness” represents the face’s perception of being kind by the respondents. These predictor variables will be used to build a classification model to predict whether or not intelligence and kindness would have influence on the symmetry of faces. \n",

    "We will create a scatterplot with intelligence and kindness at the x and y axes respectively, and symmetry/asymmetry as the class of the points. Then, adding the new face point into the plot and using K-value classification to identify the class of the new point. \n"

    "We expect to correctly predict whether a new face is symmetry or asymmetry by analyzing intelligence and kindness ratings of a human face, which is given by the existing data, rated by person.\n",

    "Our finding is the base of face recognition, and can therefore be used for artificial intelligence programs, apps, or the government, which can reduce the amount of human work necessary.\n",

    "A future question could be, “except classifying the face by symmetry and asymmetry, how can we classify the faces in another reasonable way?”\n"
